# LA Times Crosswords: Title

This is my INFO 664 Crossword Puzzle Project GitHub Repository. In this project, I have created a dataset based on the answers to the LA Times Crossword Puzzle between the years 2019-2024. I have then used this dataset to analyze thousands of crossword

    rationale statement: expresses the motivations behind the project

    workflow: identifies libraries used and explains the important steps being taken in the code.

    further uses: in what ways might someone build on this work or re-use your code.

    files list: a list of files relevant to the project (python notebooks, csv files, etc) and a brief description of what each file contains

As of right now, the only items in the repository are the Python script I have used to scrape data from the original blog that held all the answers, the uncleaned CSV containing all the data, and the cleaned and usable dataset that I made using Open Refine.
